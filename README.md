## Generate summary of any video

Generate a summary of any video through its subtitles.

This is the community driven approach towards the summarization by the **[OpenGenus](https://github.com/opengenus)** community.

# Usage

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/AdiChat/vidsum.git

$ cd vidsum/code

```
To generate summary of a video file `sample.mp4` with subtitle file `subtitle.srt` : 
```python
python sum.py -i sample.mp4 -s subtitle.srt 
```
To download a YouTube video from url:
```python
python sum.py -u "url"
```
